# WIRDUZEN Docker images

This repository builds some base docker images used for CI/CD purposes.

## Software

The images include the following software:

- PHP
- Composer
- NodeJS (and NPM)

## Build Args

By default the GitHub Actions will build the most common combinations of 
PHP and NodeJS versions. You can provide build args to control which
versions will be included.

| Arg              | Description                             | Example Value |
